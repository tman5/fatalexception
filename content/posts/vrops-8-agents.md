With the impending demise of the EPOPS agent, I was hopeful the newer ligher Telegraph agent would fully replicate the functionality. While the new agent is relatively easy to push from the console and it does a great job with built-in apps, monitoring custom services does not appear to be a feature. With EPOPS you could monitoring custom Windows services, even use a custom script. Now (with Linux as well), it appears this functionality is gone. You can still check ICMP, TCP ports and such but not like before.
