    <p>Hi. I'm Travis. I work in IT. I have a passion for all things technology. I'm always looking to what is next and never want to settle. I also am an adjunct IT professor so I have a passion for teaching technology to students. I'll write about some of that here too. I want to write about my adventures and write about cases I think may help others. I'm always looking to collaborate. Currently I'm very much engrained in VMware technologies so you'll see a lot of that here (and more!). I'm looking to the future and want to transition into SRE/DevOps/K8s (the list is endless) but suffice to say next-generation technologies that will power the infrastructures of tomorrow.</p>
