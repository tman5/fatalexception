      <description>I want to post this because I&#39;ve found the documentation and steps very unclear from VMware in regards to this. Say your security policy requires federated identities. Put simply you CANNOT just use a VMware account you create in the cloud; you MUST use your on-prem credentials (we&#39;ll use AD in this case). So how do you do that? Well it&#39;s a combination of VMware Identity Manager Connector and a VMware Identity Manager* tenant in the cloud.</description>

      <description>I cannot take credit for this, but I wanted to put it out there for all to see and understand. It originally was shown to me by Jayson Block (VCDX). There are key areas that go into desining IT systems. We probably hear them all the time - realiblity, stability, etc. Let&#39;s outline them here. This specifically can relate to VMware in this case. There are a number of academic articles discussing engineering ilities but I thought it useful here to focus on VMware.</description>

      <title>VMware Tools on Server 2012 Update Issues</title>

      <description>There seems to be issues with auto-upgrading VMware tools to the newest version on some 2012 instances. The tools will install but will crash constantly. Trouble is it&#39;s not all of them. While I haven&#39;t been able to pinpoint the issue I have found a workaround. If you uninstall the tools with setup /c and then remove ALL files from the VMware Tools directory under Program Files, then a clean install will succeed.</description>
